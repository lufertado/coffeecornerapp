Coffee Corner Invoice Application

### How to use? ###

First, the user must input the number of sold out products. Then, for each product, he must input the 
corresponding code from the product list. If the code input corresponds to any kind of coffee, user must
choose whether to include or not extras for that coffee item (Y or N). If user inputs "Y", he must 
 add the codes for the extras desired, separated by comma.

Finally, the user will be asked whether to have a customer stamps card (Y or N). If user inputs "Y", he must 
input the number of stamps in the card (1 to 5).

Once the info is captured, the application will generate an invoice file ("invoice.txt") with the detail 
of each item, the quantity and the total price, the discounts that apply and the total value, in the root directory of 
the application
